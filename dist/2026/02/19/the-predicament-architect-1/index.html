Livingston, 2-15-26</span></div></p><p>Sir Ernest Benn, in 1944, said: "Politics is the art of looking for trouble, finding it everywhere, diagnosing it wrongly and applying unsuitable remedies".</p><p>When I saw this quote, it made me think that it was not only appropriate for Politics, but could also be applied to our Maryland Election System.<br>One could say....................</p><p>"Elections provide a creative way to generate problems, find them in every process, diagnose them using a certain agenda, and apply ridiculous and convoluted remedies."</p><p>Our State Administrator, Jared DiMarinis, could be characterized as a Predicament Architect because he loves to generate problems and issues regarding Voter Registration, Accessibility, Voter Intimidation, Disenfranchisement, Misinformation and Disinformation, etc. so that he can justify creating new Policies which can appear to provide the public outstanding processes and procedures, while taking away their rights as citizens to redress their government.</p><p>Mr. DiMarinis recently made a presentation to the new Maryland General Assembly House Committee - Government, Labor and Elections Committee -  Mr. DiMarinis lauded all over himself about all the wonderful things he has dedicated himself to do to make our Election System in Maryland a National Model Standard.  To make us the Shining Star across the Nation."</p><p>Interesting, so how is he planning to do this?</p><p>One claim he made was that "...I am always proactive in my efforts, I don't believe in waiting for issues to come to Maryland before addressing them..."</p><p>O-kay, so is he imagining problems and issues that don't exist so that he can reformulate new Policies which will further convolute the System?</p><p>He wants to make sure that High Schoolers, "...understand the struggles they have and that they have always had and that they think they have always had the ability to vote or have easy access."   He goes on to say, "...that wasn't the case when some of your parents or Grandparents were alive and you have to constantly celebrate those Anniversaries to make sure, they understand that this was a right that was stripped along the way here.  It was not universally granted."</p><p>Wow, sounds a little like the word salad from Kamala Harris.</p><p>He loves to mislabel the public's concerns, when they ask questions, as misinformation and disinformation.  Another comment he made had something to do with, "...Election Administrators were always on the sidelines with the policy go round."</p><p>I have no idea what that means!  I can tell from experience, that the State Election Administrator and all the minions have always been involved with policy.  Just ask Linda Lamone.</p><p>He goes on to say, "...We are on the frontlines in this battle for mis and dis information.  It's more important than ever that we have to do outreach and I take that seriously in my feelings here."</p><p>More salad...please pass the Ranch Dressing.</p><p>If DiMarinis was an honest person, he would face the fact that it's the Election Community that is spewing mis and dis information; creating pretend problems to make the public think there are severe issues.   For example, the election offices putting up bulletproof glass in their lobbies, which makes it appear they've been threatened by violent people, like what we saw in Minneapolis or Portland.  However, the public is beginning to know and understand that this is all a show and just another way to prevent the public from being able to find out what is really going on in their election system.</p><p>His ego also shined a spotlight on itself when he said, "I am THE Trusted Source for Electoral Information, not an influencer or so-called expert on a social media platform..."</p><p>Hmmm, I'm sure he wouldn't want to have millions of people watching him on social media.  No, not THE TRUSTED SOURCE of Electoral Information! His ego would never stand for that!  Silly me!<br>He goes on to say, "...maybe they think they read something or heard something.  Especially to the younger voters I want to make sure that they come to the SBE website, tag me on social media (wait I thought he said he wasn't on social media), I'd be happy to answer their questions and make sure that 'they' understand 'their rights.</p><p>I wonder if Mr. DiMarinis has ever read the Constitution?</p><p>As far as I know, every Eligible Citizen in America has the right to vote.  I guess he doesn't know that.  Or, this is just another way to gaslight younger people into thinking that if they are concerned about elections "...not being transparent or secure that people who talk about them otherwise are just spreading lies."  And then they should run to Mr. DiMarinis because He Is The Expert!!!</p><p>He absolutely is a very creative Predicament Architect.  His mantra should be, "Let's pretend there are needs here to look over; layout some processes and procedures; then consult with our friends in the Legislature; show them our detailed tactics; negotiate the details of our agenda; and Administrate the final plan."</p><p>This Architectural mindset was evident when he told the Committee that he is "looking for new and innovative ways to enhance voting and try to achieve a 100% voter turnout."</p><p>Holy Moly - can you imagine standing in line with 4.6 million people waiting to vote?</p><p>And then he says, "If we can remove unnecessary barriers to voting that lead to disenfranchisement, I'm open to share this.  My staff and I are always willing to work with the General Assembly to share new and innovative ideas that you have and hope they are made for Maryland, and they can fit into the structure here."</p><p>Yes, Jared DiMarinis the Predicament Architect along with his "anything you say" staff, which includes the local boards, has been working to take our Election System to a level we never imagined.</p><p>With his guidance and as a "Trusted Source of Electoral Information" Mr. DiMarinis is teaching us that it is evil to ask any questions or have any concerns about our Election System.  That we must believe that we haven't really had any rights to speak of until he came along.  That it is not up to the public as to how their elections are conducted or who is conducting them, how their tax money is being spent, or how their votes are being counted.  The public should also not be concerned about how the laws are being manipulated or how new rules and regulations are put into place.</p><p>Almost sounds like Gestapo tactics.</p><p>When you get right down to it, the Predicament Architect doesn't really care about 'real' issues or problems.  If it isn't an issue or problem that he didn't think up himself, then it isn't worth his time to create the remedy or administer oversight.</p><p>His goal is to make sure he has complete control over our Election System in Maryland and that the public shuts up and knows their place - bowing to his every desire.</p>
