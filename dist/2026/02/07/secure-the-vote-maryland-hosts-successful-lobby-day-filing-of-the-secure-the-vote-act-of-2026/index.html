<p><strong>Annapolis, Maryland – February 6, 2026</strong></p>

<p>On Wednesday, February 4, concerned citizens from across Maryland volunteered their time in Annapolis to advocate for the Secure the Vote Act of 2026, a sweeping election integrity bill formally filed at 4:59 PM in the Maryland State House.</p>

<p>Participants gathered in Annapolis and organized into teams that visited both House of Delegates and Senate offices, engaging lawmakers and staff in substantive discussions about the bill's provisions and the growing public demand for secure, transparent, and trustworthy elections.</p>

<p>The Secure the Vote Act of 2026, developed in collaboration with the Maryland Freedom Caucus, was designed to address every known vulnerability in Maryland's election system and establish the strongest election safeguards in state history. The legislation implements a comprehensive election-security framework by restoring proven integrity measures and closing longstanding gaps in Maryland election law.</p>

<h2>Key Provisions of the Secure the Vote Act of 2026</h2>

<p>During meetings with legislators and staff, volunteers emphasized that the bill is not piecemeal reform, but a full-spectrum election security package built on multiple reinforcing protections, including:</p>

<h3>1. Voter Identification (Voter ID)</h3>
<p>Mandated voter identification is the cornerstone of the Secure the Vote Act. National support for Voter ID is overwhelming, with recent polling showing strong bipartisan backing. Advocates underscored that Voter ID protects lawful voters, deters fraud, and strengthens public confidence in election outcomes.</p>

<h3>2. Proof of U.S. Citizenship</h3>
<p>The bill establishes a clear and enforceable proof-of-citizenship requirement for voter registration. While it is already illegal for non-citizens to vote or falsely claim citizenship, Maryland currently lacks a verification process. Advocates raised concerns that non-citizens have been able to register through the Motor Voter system with no follow-up verification. The Secure the Vote Act closes this loophole.</p>

<h3>3. Prohibition on Non-Citizen Voting in Municipal Elections</h3>
<p>The bill explicitly prohibits non-citizens from voting in Maryland municipal elections, reinforcing the principle that voting is a right reserved exclusively for U.S. citizens.</p>

<h3>4. Elimination of Ballot Drop Boxes</h3>
<p>To reduce ballot harvesting, chain-of-custody failures, and unverifiable ballot collection, the bill repeals the use of ballot drop boxes statewide.</p>

<h3>5. Repeal of No-Excuse Mail-In Voting</h3>
<p>The legislation restores traditional absentee voting standards, limiting mail-in ballots to voters with a legitimate reason and reducing opportunities for fraud and coercion.</p>

<h3>6. Signature Verification for Absentee Ballots</h3>
<p>Recognizing Maryland's extensive use of mail voting, the bill establishes meaningful signature verification requirements to ensure ballots are cast by the registered voter and to maintain confidence in absentee voting.</p>

<h2>Meetings with Lawmakers and Staff</h2>

<p>The Secure the Vote Maryland team assembled at the Maryland House of Delegates, where they met with delegates and senators to discuss key election security issues and outline the objectives of the day's advocacy efforts.</p>

<p>Teams visited numerous legislative offices, and many lawmakers and staff acknowledged broad public support for election integrity reforms, particularly voter identification. Secure the Vote Maryland extends sincere appreciation to the Chiefs of Staff and legislative aides who took time to listen, ask questions, and engage in thoughtful dialogue.</p>

<h2>Final vote count:</h2>

<p>Thirty-seven of the thirty-nine Republicans supported the bill. Every Democrat in the legislature declined to support the Secure the Vote Act, along with one Republican, Delegate April Rose of Carroll County. Delegate Joshua Stonko of Carroll County could not be reached to provide permission to cosign.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>Secure the Vote Maryland is currently awaiting assignment of the House Bill number. Advocacy efforts will continue as the legislation moves forward, with a focus on educating lawmakers and the public about the importance of restoring transparency, accountability, and trust in Maryland's elections.</p>

<p>The strong turnout, constructive conversations, and positive reception during Lobby Day demonstrate that Marylanders are ready for common-sense election safeguards—and willing to stand up for them.</p>
