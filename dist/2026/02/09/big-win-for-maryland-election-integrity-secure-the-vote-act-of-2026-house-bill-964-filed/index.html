</header>
<div class="content">
<p>We are thrilled to share some huge news out of Annapolis! On Wednesday, February 4, 2026, the hard work of the team at Secure the Vote Maryland paid off in a big way: the Secure the Vote Act of 2026 was officially filed as <a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2026rs/bills_noln/hb/fhb0964.pdf">House Bill 964 in the Maryland General Assembly</a>! This marks a major milestone for our mission, and we couldn't be more excited to see this crucial legislation take shape.</p>

<p>Following up on the success of our Lobby Day and the incredible energy from advocates across the state, HB 964 has now taken its first formal step toward becoming law — a testament to the dedication, passion, and teamwork behind our movement.</p>

<h2>What's in House Bill 964 — Secure the Vote Act of 2026?</h2>

<p>House Bill 964 makes comprehensive reforms to strengthen Maryland's election laws with a clear focus on:</p>

<h3>✅ Solidifying Voter ID Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>Establishes clear requirements for identification at the polling place, including requiring voters to present valid government-issued photo ID or, alternatively, specific supporting documents if they don't have photo ID.</li>
<li>Creates a State Board of Elections program to issue standardized photo IDs for voting purposes, making secure ID more accessible to all eligible voters.</li>
<li>Election judges must verify voter identity before issuing ballots, and provisional ballots are available only when identification cannot be provided. (<a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2026rs/bills_noln/hb/fhb0964.pdf">Maryland General Assembly</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>✅ Ensuring Only U.S. Citizens Can Register and Vote</h3>

<ul>
<li>New provisions require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship when registering to vote.</li>
<li>The bill prohibits non-U.S. citizens from being registered or voting in municipal elections. (<a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2026rs/bills_noln/hb/fhb0964.pdf">Maryland General Assembly</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>✅ Strengthening Voter Registration Integrity</h3>

<ul>
<li>Before each statewide primary, the State Board must conduct a full audit of the voter registration list, identifying and removing duplicates, deceased individuals, non-residents, and individuals who are not U.S. citizens. (<a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2026rs/bills_noln/hb/fhb0964.pdf">Maryland General Assembly</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>✅ Tightening Absentee Voting Rules and Signature Verification</h3>

<ul>
<li>Absentee ballots can only be used by voters who are unable to vote in person due to specific, defined circumstances.</li>
<li>All absentee ballots must include a signed oath affirming eligibility, and local election boards must verify the voter's signature on absentee ballot envelopes before counting. (<a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2026rs/bills_noln/hb/fhb0964.pdf">Maryland General Assembly</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Key Measures:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Ballot drop boxes — including those at the Baltimore City centralized booking facility — are removed from state law.</li>
<li>Permanent absentee ballot status and authority for special mail elections are repealed.</li>
<li>Municipal elections will be governed by uniform statewide standards for voter ID, registration maintenance, ballot security, and audits. (<a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2026rs/bills_noln/hb/fhb0964.pdf">Maryland General Assembly</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>What This Means for Maryland</h2>

<p>This bill represents a strong step toward election security, transparency, and public confidence. By codifying modern voter ID standards, ensuring that only eligible U.S. citizens are registered and able to vote, and requiring rigorous signature and registration list verification, the Secure the Vote Act of 2026 aims to protect the integrity of Maryland's elections while maintaining access for legitimately qualified voters.</p>

<p>We are proud of the progress made so far and energized for what comes next, committee hearings, grassroots engagement, and continued advocacy. This successful filing is your victory, and we are just getting started!</p>

<p>Stay tuned for updates and opportunities to support HB 964 as it moves through the General Assembly!</p>
