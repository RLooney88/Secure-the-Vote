<h1>Secure the Vote Maryland Testifies Against Redistricting Bill HB488</h1>
</header>
<div class="content">
<p><strong>Witness:</strong> Katherine Strauch Sullivan</p>

<p><strong>Jurisdiction:</strong> Baltimore County</p>

<p><strong>Bill:</strong> HB488 Election Districts – General Assembly and Representatives in Congress</p>

<p><strong>Position:</strong> AGAINST HB488</p>

<p>HB488 is nothing but a political stunt forced on us by Governor Moore for his own self-serving political ambitions. It is clearly designed to manipulate district lines for partisan advantage rather than to address legitimate demographic or constitutional concerns. Such gerrymandering erodes voter confidence, undermines faith in elections, and reinforces the perception that Annapolis prioritizes political games over the real problems facing Marylanders.</p>

<p>At a time when families are concerned about affordability, jobs, and economic stability, this bill diverts attention and taxpayer resources toward unnecessary political maneuvering instead of "kitchen-table issues."</p>

<p>This proposal is especially misguided given Maryland's broader challenges. The state continues to experience significant domestic out-migration, losing approximately 18,500 residents to other states in a single recent year, ranking near the bottom nationally. In addition, Moody's downgraded Maryland's credit rating in 2025, citing fiscal and economic pressures—the first downgrade in decades.</p>

<p>Maryland is struggling. Lawmakers should focus on restoring economic confidence, retaining residents, and addressing affordability—not engaging in partisan redistricting fights.</p>

<p>Marylanders expect results, not political stunts. HB488 should be rejected.</p>
