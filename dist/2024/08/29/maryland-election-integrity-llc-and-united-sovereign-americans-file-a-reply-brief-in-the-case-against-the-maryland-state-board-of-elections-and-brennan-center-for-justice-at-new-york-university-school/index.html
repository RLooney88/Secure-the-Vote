<div class="content">
<p>ANNAPOLIS, MD – August 29, 2024 Maryland Election Integrity LLC and United Sovereign Americans, represented by Ed Hartman of Hartman, Attorneys at Law and Bruce Castor Jr of van der Veen, Hartshorn, Levin, & Lindheim, filed a <a href="/2024/08/29/reply-brief-of-appellants/">Reply Brief</a> in response to the lower court's refusal to hear the case based on standing in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</p>

<p>A strong reply to the court starts with a very compelling argument, "Appellee's arguments with respect to Maryland Election Integrity's standing are without merit and attempt to impose additional requirements never before required by this Court."</p>

<p>Maryland Election Integrity provided through its Amended Complaint "a series of facts establishing that its members are individuals qualified to vote in Maryland whose votes have been diluted through the Maryland State Board of Elections' failure to ensure that its voting systems and voter registration records meet certain federal standards prior to certifying the vote."</p>

<p>Maryland Election Integrity and its members have a clear mission to guard the sanctity of Maryland's Federal Elections. The mission is being impeded by the various violations of federal and state law outlined in the lawsuit.</p>

<p>The Reply Brief can be read here.</p>
