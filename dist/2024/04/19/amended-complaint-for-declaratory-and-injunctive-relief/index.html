              IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND Maryland Election Integrity LLC * 116 Defense Highway, * Annapolis, MD 21401 * * Plaintiff * * United Sovereign Americans, Inc. * 167 Lamp and Lantern Village Suite 194 * Chesterfield, MO 63017 * * Plaintiff * *&nbsp; Case No.: 1:24-cv-00672-SAG v. * * Maryland State Board of Elections * 151 West Street #200 * Annapolis, MD 21401 * * SERVE ON: Michael G. Summers, * In his representative capacity as the Chairman * of the Maryland State Board of Elections * 151 West Street #200 * Annapolis, MD 21401 * * Defendant * ****************************************************************************** AMENDED &#8211; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF Maryland Election Integrity LLC, a Maryland limited liability company, and United Sovereign Americans, Inc., a Missouri nonprofit corporation, Plaintiffs, by Hartman, Attorneys at Law, and C. Edward Hartman, III, hereby bring this Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, and plead as follows: PARTIES Maryland Election Integrity LLC is a Maryland limited liability company. Its principal office is located in Maryland. United Sovereign Americans, Inc. is a nonprofit corporation incorporated in the state of Missouri. Maryland State Board of Elections (hereinafter referred to as “MDSBE”) is a government agency that administers elections in Maryland. JURISDICTION AND VENUE This action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief from deficient voter registration rolls leading to violations of Federal and state laws, the certification of results from a provably flawed, inaccurate, and obscure process outside the view of impartial witnesses or the public, including the use of voting systems in Maryland that are believed to have void EAC certifications in violation of federal law, and the refusal of the Maryland State Board of Elections to comply with Public Information Act (PIA) requests and Federally required transparency. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this complaint because the case presents substantial questions of federal law, and the state claims are so related to the federal claims that they form part of the same case or controversy. 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1367. This court has original jurisdiction for any action in the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the Plaintiffs under 28 U.S.C. § 1361. This court has authority to issue a declaratory judgment and to order injunctive and other relief that is necessary and proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§2201 and 2202 as there exists a case of actual controversy. This court has personal jurisdiction as the Defendant is a Maryland Agency. Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1). STANDING Maryland Election Integrity LLC is an organization containing members who are registered voters in the state of Maryland. Kate Sullivan, a member of Maryland Election Integrity LLC, and a Baltimore County resident canvassed Baltimore County and found inaccurate voter registration records and the effect of this on the entire voting process. The members have been and are currently harmed by the MDSBE and the ES&amp;S voting systems currently and formerly in use in Maryland elections. The violations of Maryland election laws, the US Constitution, and Federal civil rights laws pertaining to voter registration rolls, transparency, compliance, and certification of the voting systems, and the serious issues hereinafter discussed with the overall voting systems exemplify their injury. The lack of transparency by MDSBE with respect to the voting systems and the reports generated by them has resulted in Plaintiffs being denied lawful Public Information Act (PIA) requests and the Federally mandated preservation of auditable items. If the Court grants Plaintiffs’ requested relief, the injury to the Plaintiffs’ members would cease to exist. The Supreme Court has indicated that if one party to a lawsuit has standing, other entities can join as parties without having to satisfy independently the demands of Article III, provided those parties do not seek a distinct form of relief from the party with standing. E.g., Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433, 446 (2009). United Sovereign Americans is not seeking a distinct form of relief and, therefore, has standing. BACKGROUND Article 1 Section 2 of the US Constitution grants the right to choose representatives to the people of the several states, according to the voting eligibility requirements of the state. The Fourteenth Amendment Section 1 defines a citizen as all people born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof. The Fourteenth Amendment Section 2 protects the eligible citizen voters of a state against both denial, or abridgment in any way, of their vote. The National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) was passed for the purpose of ensuring accurate, current voter registration rolls. Congress’ power to pass NVRA comes from Article 1, Section 8, Clause 18 of the US Constitution, the Necessary and Proper Clause, making accurate voter rolls a requirement to uphold the right of the people to choose their representatives. Of the three components of an election, voters, votes, and counts, in that order, each relies on the accuracy of the preceding component(s) in order to be trustworthy. Without all being intact, the system will not meet the requirements for certifying the vote, plainly needing the ability to prove both accuracy and compliance. It is a settled legal principle that dilution of a qualified voter’s vote is a form of disenfranchisement, Ex parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371 (1879), United States v. Saylor, 322 U. S. 385 (1944), Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964). The Help America Vote Act requires that voter roll databases contain only the registrations of qualified citizen voters residing in that state. 52 USC § 21083(a). Each qualified voter is granted a unique statewide identifier in the database, averting the risk of double-voting, or extra ballots being cast in the name of a particular voter. Further, the constitutional mandate is that the election system must only count eligible voters. Maryland cannot demonstrate that there is effective control of eligibility in Federal or State dimensions of those requirements and has implemented a system that does not guarantee accuracy or compliance with only allowing eligible voters to register and vote. The Help America Vote Act requires that federal elections adhere to an accuracy standard, “...set at a sufficiently stringent level such that the likelihood of voting system errors affecting the outcome of an election is exceptionally remote even in the closest of elections.” United States. (2002) U.S. Federal Election Commission FEC . United States. [Web Archive] Retrieved from the Election Assistance Commission, https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/eac_assets/1/28/Voting_System_Standards_Volume_I.pdf. For a voting system, accuracy is defined as the ability of the system to capture the intent of the voters without error. United States. (2002) U.S. Federal Election Commission FEC . United States. [Web Archive] Retrieved from the Election Assistance Commission, https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/eac_assets/1/28/Voting_System_Standards_Volume_I.pdf. FACTS Voter Rolls The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) codified at 52 USC § 20501(a) states, “The Congress finds that the right of citizens of the United States to vote is a fundamental right [(emphasis added)] [and] it is the duty of the Federal, State, and local governments to promote the exercise of that right.” The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) states that “[t]he purposes of this act are to ensure that accurate and current voter registration rolls are maintained.” 52 USC § 20501(b)(4). The NVRA invariably imposes a duty upon government officials to promote the exercise of citizens’ right to vote through current and accurate voter rolls. The NVRA defers to state voter registration procedures in some instances and generally serves as a guideline for states to implement voter registration practices consistent with the NVRA. As such, Maryland and Federal laws have become intertwined and violations of state law violate the NVRA. A recent audit of the MDSBE voter registration database done by the Maryland General Assembly’s Office of Legislative Audits found numerous instances of inaccuracies and vulnerabilities in the states list maintenance practices, including 2,426 deceased registrants and 327 duplicate voter registrations. See Office of Legislative Audits, Audit Report: State Board of Elections (Oct. 2023), available at https://www.marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SBE23.pdf (last accessed Dec. 27, 2023). Meticulous analysis of the official Maryland State Voter Registration Database reveals a minimum of 79,392 current apparent registration violations (Voter Registration Database snapshots were purchased 8/2021, 12/2021, 7/2022, 8/2022, 12/2022, 1/2023, 2/2023, 3/2023, 4/2023, 5/2023, 6/2023, and 7/2023). The analysis revealed 1,699 instances of duplicate registrations, 25,084 instances of registrants with questionable inactive status, 3,366 instances of active registrations without a certified US Post Office mailing address, 5,680 instances of active registrants who moved at least 4 years ago, 605 instances of registrations with no residential address, 296 instances of active registrants with a nonstandard address, 1,218 instances of active registrants who are deceased, 883 instances of age discrepant registration (younger than 18 or older than 115), and 40,518 instances of questionable registration date. A spreadsheet with the apparent registration violations is attached as Exhibit A. Exhibit A shows the registration type, the number of apparent violations, and the Maryland election law/rule in violation. The specific violations of the NVRA can be
