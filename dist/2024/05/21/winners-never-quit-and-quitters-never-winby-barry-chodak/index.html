    <title>Winners Never Quit and Quitters Never Win By Barry Chodak</title>

<p>Few of us can really say that we were surprised that the lawsuit was dismissed for lack of standing. Still, many are disappointed. It is those to whom I address this.</p>
<p>Standing didn't exist until 1922. It was created by the courts, not Congress. For over a hundred years, legal minds have been engaged in an ongoing battle, with lawyers looking for ways to get over the hurdle and jurists looking to raise the bar. Legal minds greater in sum than any single practitioner, have consistently been failing. Congratulations, you are now a player in the game. While we have not achieved our goal yet, the only losers in this game are the ones that quit. That's not us.</p>
<p>As Tsun Su counsels, know your adversary. Who are they? They are the managerial class, the believers in government as the answer, the sociopaths and psychopaths that aspire to positions of power, and the naïve acolytes who administer the agencies. They also include most of the teachers who taught them, the media they listen to, and the movies they have been watching all their lives. Lest we get cocky, they also include us. We are not immune to the infection that has been spreading for those hundred years.</p>
<p>What are the actions to be taking?</p>
<p>-Educate yourself to recognize the danger when power and authority are concentrated in smaller and smaller groups. Thomas Paine masterfully saw that kings had but two things to do: make war and give out spoils to their courtiers. Does that sound familiar?</p>
<p>-Share with others about the process. Be smart about this and don't try to convert the true believers. They are not listening.</p>
<p>-Contribute to those engaged in the battle. On the legal front, I single out America First Legal and 1776 Law Center. Also consider a contribution to John Eastman or Jeff Clark.</p>
<p>All the above are actions in the Court of Public Opinion. While we can be encouraged when some negotiate the standing hurdle, the ultimate victory will only come by legislative action. Given that this is election season, pay attention to the candidates that challenge the administrative state.</p>
