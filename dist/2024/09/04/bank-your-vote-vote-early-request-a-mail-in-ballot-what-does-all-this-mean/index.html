              The upcoming November election has introduced a variety of new terms and procedures, leaving many voters puzzled. What do phrases like &#8220;vote early,&#8221; &#8220;request a mail-in ballot,&#8221; and &#8220;bank your vote&#8221; mean, and how can you ensure that your vote is counted? To start, it’s important to understand how voting has evolved. The days of a single voting day and absentee ballots are behind us. Instead, voting options have expanded to include Early Voting and Election Day. In Maryland, for example, Early Voting runs from October 24 to October 31, 2024, offering eight days of in-person voting at designated locations across the state. Election Day, however, remains on the traditional first Tuesday in November, which this year falls on November 5, 2024. The term &#8220;absentee ballot&#8221; has been replaced by &#8220;mail-in ballot,&#8221; a change that occurred during the 2020 pandemic. Alongside this, ballot drop boxes were introduced as an alternative to mailing ballots through the U.S. Postal Service, though their use has sparked controversy. &#8220;Bank Your Vote&#8221; is another term that has entered the election lexicon. This phrase encourages voters to secure their votes early, either by voting in person during Early Voting or by submitting a mail-in ballot. An essential step in this process is verifying that your vote has been registered, which can be done through your county’s voter registration database using your voter identification number. What course of action should you take for the November 2024 Presidential election? That is a weighty question with a not so easy answer. Those of us working diligently to make sure this election is fair and accurate are recommending either vote early or request a mail-in-ballot. If requesting a mail-in-ballot, once you receive the ballot and fill it out be sure to return it directly to your county election office. Why? This is to be sure your ballot is received by the board of elections versus through the US Postal System.&nbsp; However, note if you request a mail in ballot &#8212; you have given up your right to vote in person.&nbsp; Behind the scenes there is a lot of chatter regarding cyber attacks and other possible nefarious actors disrupting Election Day November 5 th . The comparison can be made with Arizona in 2020 where printers broke, machines could not read the ballots and voters became disenfranchised. It is possible that a similar situation could occur nationwide. This is especially possible since Homeland Security has already issued warnings of a cyber-attack on election day.&nbsp; Given the complexities and potential risks surrounding the 2024 Presidential election, such as the threat of cyber-attacks and other disruptions on Election Day, many experts recommend either voting early or request a mail-in ballot. If you choose the latter, it is crucial to return your completed ballot directly to your county election office rather than through the U.S. Postal Service. This direct delivery helps ensure that your vote is securely received by the board of elections. In conclusion, whether you choose to vote early, in person or by mail-in-ballot it’s important your voice is heard in the November 2024 election. In the state of Maryland, a law passed in 2023 stating only the first vote counts. In other words, if your ballot or voter registration shows that a mail-in-ballot was requested then you can only vote by mail-in-ballot. This means if a nefarious actor stole your ballot, then your vote was also stolen. A small precinct in Baltimore County experienced this with three voters. The record stated they had requested absentee ballots (however, they did not). Their only choice was to vote provisionally which means their provisional votes most likely did not count. Bank your vote or vote early to ensure your vote is counted! To request a Maryland mail-in-ballot: https://voterservices.elections.maryland.gov/onlinemailinrequest/InstructionsStep1
