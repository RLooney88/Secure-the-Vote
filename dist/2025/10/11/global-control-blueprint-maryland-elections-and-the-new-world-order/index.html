              By Dale Livingston October 2025 After watching a few videos regarding the dynamics of the strategy and plan for a ‘One World Order’/’New World Order’, it started to occur to me that these plans were exactly how our Election System was being manipulated and is continuing to be centrally controlled by the Maryland State Board of Elections and ultimately by the ‘One World’ puppet masters. None of this, or all of this, may be known to those of us who have been working for Election Integrity in Maryland for the past 5+ years. But it is worth thinking about in terms of the bigger picture so that we can understand the plurality of what we are dealing with. The main focus, as prescribed by the founders of this ‘One World Order’/’New World Order’ idea, was to erode sovereignty from the bottom up, piece by piece. The idea was to create Custom’s Unions, Confederations, Regionalism, Centralization and finally culminating into the One World Order goal. How did this all start? Rockefeller recruited Kissinger; Kissinger recruited Klaus Schwab; Klaus Schwab was put in charge of the World Economic Forum (WEF). Klaus Schwab wrote the book, “ COVID, the Great Reset .” This was part of the strategy of Globalization. Kissinger also introduced Benjamin Netanyahu to America as a young boy, and put him through college in America, then sent him back to Israel and put him into power there. Let that sink in! I added this little tidbit because it is an example of the fact that no Government is impenetrable to the Deep State. We have learned that about our own Government. I’ve said this before, it is not the people of the Countries who are the problem – it is the Governments running roughshod over their people. Part of Regionalism is almost like the concept of the “15 Minute City”, where countries create closer knit relationships with a few other countries – ie: In Klaus Schwab’s book, he states that “...the three states that compose North America, now trade more with each other than with China or Europe.” This is independent regionalism. Which makes it much easier to eventually pull them all together into ONE! .................................................................................. How did Maryland get started in the pursuit of this Control over the Public and therefore becoming a part of this ‘New World Order’? In 1994, Paris Glendening and Ellen Saurbrey ran against each other for the Governorship of Maryland. Glendening won, Ellen Saurbrey sued for Voter Fraud. (See attached history.) Without getting into the weeds, the results of the election were determined by an Absentee ballot run-off &#8211; Glendening won – 50.21% against Saurbrey’s 49.78%. (Sound familiar?) And as you will see in the attached history of this Election debacle, the evidence presented in the lawsuit were the very same issues we have been investigating for more than 5 years – deceased still on the rolls , voters using vacant lots for their addresses, felons on the rolls, ineligible people on the voter rolls, voters who moved but still voting, etc. etc. Nothing has changed. And, guess who was one of Glendening’s lawyers for this lawsuit! Some of you may have guessed – Linda Lamone. Prior to this Gubernatorial Election, from 1983 – 1987 Lamone was the original legal counsel for the State Administrative Board of Election Law, then between 1987 and 1989 Lamone was Special Counsel for Lt. Governor Melvin Steinberg, who was Donald Schaefer’s Lt. Governor. In 1969 the General Assembly created a State Administrative Board of Elections. Prior to this, elections were supervised by the Secretary of State and the Local Boards conducted elections and maintained their own county voter rolls. In 1997, Glendening appointed Linda Lamone as Administrator of the State Administrative Board of Elections, and then on January 1, 1999 this agency was renamed as the State Board of Elections (SBOE). In 1997 the State Administrative Board of Elections employed 23 people and their budget was $1,260,987. While Lamone was the Administrator, 1997 to 2023, the staffing rose to 46 people and the budget increased to $46,012,886. When Lamone left and Jared DeMarinis took over as State Administrator the staffing rose to 55 and the budget went from $46,012,886 to $57,954,719. ........................................................................................ So how does this all fit in or relate to a ‘New World Order’? I have said that there is a process being strategically planned to centralize our Elections in Maryland, by slowly removing responsibilities and authorities from our Local County Boards of Elections and pulling them into the State Board of Elections. This can be compared to how the WEF and other global organizations are corralling countries by fomenting wars and other means to control the people – COVID is a prime example of this. And COVID was another example of a blatant disrespect of our liberties and freedoms and of our American Election System. Our Country used COVID to control our Elections in 2020 and disallow our Local Boards to decide what was best for their people in their States and Counties. COVID wasn’t the groundwork for the Big ‘One World’ Picture, but it sure did help the effort. Prior to Covid, Lamone and Legislators were working to take control of our Election Processes and Procedures. As stated above, Linda Lamone has been controlling things in Maryland Elections for decades. Once Glendening appointed her, she wanted to make sure she would remain the Election Administrator for life, and thanks to Steny Hoyer, that happened. She has been protected by our Legislators ever since. Over the past 10 years, our State Board of Elections has glommed onto this State Control idea introduced by Klaus Schwab and the Puppet Masters of The New World Order. One of the ways they have done this is by fomenting issues that don’t even exist. For example, having the Local Boards of Elections claim they were being threatened by the Public so they had to install Bullet-Proof glass in their lobbies; the purchase of Drop Boxes so that the Public didn’t have to go into a polling place or a post office for fear of COVID exposure; instituting perpetual and universal mail-in ballots so that less and less people would go to the polls to vote in person, and in so doing not only take away a sense of responsibility the people should have for their own Franchise, but also to control election outcomes; preventing the local election officials from verifying citizenship; implementing Same Day Registration with no vetting process to allow ineligible people to vote. These are only a few of the major processes and procedures that the SBOE has implemented in the last 13 years. Underneath all of this is the constant manipulation of legislation, rules and regulations, that are created by the State Board of Elections with the assistance of legislators who, I believe, share the belief in the New World Order centralization concept. The Local Boards of Elections are being ‘groomed’ to ignore the Public’s requests by simply claiming things like, “there are no documents to satisfy your request”; or not allowing the public to ask questions during a Board Meeting; or blatantly ignoring public requests so that the public has no other choice but to try to get relief from the State A.G. Ombudsman. The State Board Administrator, Jared DeMarinis, is even ignoring the Federal DOJ, the Counsel for the Maryland GOP and the Republican Freedom Caucus of Maryland . All of this points to an effective ‘bottoms up’ strategy by the New World Order puppet masters. They have infiltrated strategic areas in each State – like the judicial systems and also Elections; manipulated the decision makers into wanting more power, ie: Lamone to be an Administrative lifer; these puppets then indoctrinate the Local Official puppets with promises and money so that they will stop caring about the people’s rights and rather look at these rights as selfish needs and desires. Since these Local Boards of Elections, no long have a feeling of responsibility toward their voters, voter rolls or toward the public in general, they can and do steer the public back up to the State Board, who in turn has no feeling of responsibility to the public or even to Government Agencies, like the DOJ. The SBOE merely steers the public toward the legislators, State Ombudsman or Judicial system, which they know that 9.9 times out of 10, is a losing proposition for the public as they are either ignored or told they have no standing. And the SBOE steers agencies like the DOJ into a brick wall with the arrogance of a haughty 15-year-old. The WEF must be very proud of Maryland, as they are diligently following the Plan. ....................................................................................... What is our remedy? What do I know? What do any of us know? We are just trying to make sure our elections are safe and fair. We want to live our lives without having to worry about our elections. But if we think that we can just turn over that responsibility to people we do not know or think we can trust, we are in essence giving up our liberties and freedoms. We are relinquishing our duties and responsibilities for our rights and our children’s rights. We must be willing to accept that our Government Agencies are being manipulated and controlled from a very high level. This is not hyperbolic and did not happen overnight. We have to understand that in order to make any progress to stop this, we need to stand stronger in our resolve. We cannot play nice, we cannot take anything or anyone for granted, we cannot trust anyone until they have proven they can be trusted. A smile does not indicate you are liked nor that you are worthy of assistance or regard. It is our responsibility and duty to take on situations that may seem impossible to address, but that are not impenetrable. All problems have holes, which means all problems can have a solution, regardless of wha
