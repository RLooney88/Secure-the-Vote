<h1>Maryland Election Board Compliance: Ensuring Accountability and Transparency By Dale Livingston</h1>
</header>
<div class="content">
<p>In recent years, Americans have become increasingly aware that some government agencies and elected officials are not adhering to the very rules, regulations, and laws they are responsible for creating and enforcing. This growing awareness has also exposed the widespread waste and misuse of taxpayer dollars—funds that are meant to support public services and government operations. Without taxpayers, the government would have no money at all, yet accountability remains a persistent challenge.</p>

<p>Election boards are no exception to this issue. As stewards of our democratic process, they have a duty to uphold transparency and compliance. However, in many cases, they are failing to meet these obligations.</p>

<h2>The Role of Election Jurisdictions in Maryland</h2>

<p>Maryland has 24 election jurisdictions, one in each of its 23 counties and Baltimore City. These local election offices are funded by millions of taxpayer dollars allocated to ensure the smooth operation of elections. Given that they function as government agencies, not private entities, they have a responsibility to serve the public with integrity. Unfortunately, some election offices have lost sight of their duty.</p>

<p>For example, not all local election offices comply with the Open Meetings Act, which guarantees public access to government board meetings, including the right to speak, review agendas, and examine meeting minutes. This law is essential for ensuring that election processes remain open and transparent. Moreover, the State Election Board Administrator is tasked with ensuring that local election boards adhere to this law—yet, in many instances, enforcement has been lacking.</p>

<h2>Strengthening Public Oversight of Election Boards</h2>

<p>Recognizing these shortcomings, Senator Cheryl Kagan and Delegate Marc Korman have introduced legislation aimed at reinforcing compliance with the Open Meetings Act across all government entities. This bill seeks to ensure that the public is always included in government decision-making, particularly in election oversight. If passed, it will mark a significant step toward restoring public trust in our electoral system.</p>

<h2>The Mission of Secure the Vote Maryland</h2>

<p>Secure the Vote Maryland is a grassroots organization made up of concerned citizens dedicated to bringing honesty, validity, security, accuracy, and transparency to our election system. Our mission is to hold election officials accountable for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Being responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars</li>

<li>Maintaining accurate and up-to-date voter records</li>

<li>Engaging openly with the public and fostering transparency</li>

<li>Upholding the fundamental right to vote for all eligible citizens</li>
</ul>

<p>Elections are the foundation of our democracy, and the public must have confidence in the systems that govern them. By advocating for accountability, we can help ensure that election boards fulfill their duties and serve the public interest.</p>
