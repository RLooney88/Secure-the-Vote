<p>The proposed Signature Verification bill aims to enhance the integrity and public trust in Maryland's absentee voting system by requiring a verified voter signature-and, in most cases, a witness signature-on all returned absentee ballots. This legislation ensures that only legally cast ballots are counted by mandating local boards of elections to confirm that each absentee ballot was submitted by the registered voter, using signature comparison against official registration records. In a time when absentee and mail-in voting are increasingly common, implementing this safeguard is essential to deterring fraud, preventing unauthorized voting, and preserving the accuracy of election results. Signature verification is already a widely accepted best practice in many states, balancing accessibility with security while maintaining consistency across jurisdictions. Currently, Maryland lacks a uniform standard for signature verification, and this legislation seeks to correct that gap-bringing the state in line with proven national election security practices and reinforcing the legitimacy of every vote counted.</p><p> </p><p><strong><span style="background: yellow; color: unset;">Why signature verification is essential to accurate and trustworthy elections:</span></strong></p><ul><li><strong><span style="background: yellow; color: unset;">Ensures Election Integrity</span></strong>: <span style="background: yellow; color: unset;">Signature verification provides a layer of security to confirm that the absentee ballot was cast by the registered voter, helping prevent fraud and unauthorized voting.</span></li><li><strong><span style="background: yellow; color: unset;">Promotes Voter Confidence</span></strong>: <span style="background: yellow; color: unset;">Voters are more likely to trust the electoral process when safeguards like signature verification are in place to ensure the authenticity of ballots.</span></li><li><strong><span style="background: yellow; color: unset;">Balances Accessibility and Security</span></strong>: <span style="background: yellow; color: unset;">While absentee voting expands access, verifying signatures ensures that increased accessibility does not compromise the integrity of the election.</span></li><li><strong><span style="background: yellow; color: unset;">Aligns with Best Practices</span></strong>: <span style="background: yellow; color: unset;">Signature verification is a standard practice in many states and is a proven method for safeguarding mail-in and absentee voting systems.</span></li><li><strong><span style="background: yellow; color: unset;">Protects Against Misuse</span></strong>: <span style="background: yellow; color: unset;">By requiring a signature match, the process deters attempts to tamper with or forge absentee ballots.</span></li><li><strong><span style="background: yellow; color: unset;">Supports Accurate Election Outcomes</span></strong>: <span style="background: yellow; color: unset;">Verifying signatures reduces the risk of counting invalid ballots, ensuring that only legally cast votes are included in the final tally.</span></li><li><strong><span style="background: yellow; color: unset;">Maintains Uniform Standards</span></strong>: <span style="background: yellow; color: unset;">Establishing clear guidelines for signature verification provides consistency in election administration across jurisdictions.</span></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>A BILL ENTITLED</strong><br /><strong>AN ACT concerning</strong><br /><strong>Election Law - Absentee Ballots - Signature Requirements and Verification</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>FOR the purpose of</strong> prohibiting a local board of elections from removing an absentee ballot from a return envelope or ballot/return envelope or counting the ballot unless the return envelope or ballot/return envelope is signed by the voter and, except under certain circumstances, a witness, and requiring the local board to verify the voter's signature; and generally relating to absentee ballots.</p><p> </p><p><strong>BY repealing and reenacting, with amendments,</strong><br />Article - Election Law<br />Section 9-303 and 9-310(a)(5) and (c)<br />Annotated Code of Maryland<br />(2022 Replacement Volume and 2023 Supplement)</p><p> </p><p><strong>BY adding to</strong><br />Article - Election Law<br />Section 9-310.1<br />Annotated Code of Maryland<br />(2022 Replacement Volume and 2023 Supplement)</p><p> </p><p><strong>SECTION 1.
